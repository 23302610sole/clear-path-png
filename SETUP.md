# University Clearance System Setup Guide

## Database Setup

To complete your University Clearance System setup, you need to run the database setup SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor

2. **Execute Database Setup**
   - Copy the entire content from `src/lib/database-setup.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the SQL

3. **Create Sample Users (Optional)**
   - You can create test users directly in the Supabase Auth section
   - Then add corresponding records in the students or department_users tables

## Environment Variables

Make sure your Supabase environment variables are properly configured:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Testing the System

### Sample Student Data
```sql
-- Add a sample student (after creating the auth user)
INSERT INTO public.students (id, student_id, full_name, email, department, phone)
VALUES (
  'auth_user_uuid_here',
  'STU001',
  'John Doe',
  'john.doe@student.unitech.ac.pg',
  'Computer Science',
  '+675 123 4567'
);
```

### Sample Department User Data
```sql
-- Add a sample department user (after creating the auth user)
INSERT INTO public.department_users (id, username, full_name, email, department, role)
VALUES (

  'lib_officer',
  'Jane Smith',
  'jane.smith@unitech.ac.pg',
